<hr>
<ol>
<li>Several hormonal and structural changes happen which lead to the differentiation and further devlopment of <strong>floral primordium</strong> before flower in seen on a plant.</li>
<li>Inflorecences are formed which bears the floral bud and then the flowers.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structures of a flower</strong></li>
<li>Androecium</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It is the male reproductive organ of the flower.</li>
<li>Androecium consists of <strong>stamens</strong>.</li>
<li>The number and length of stamens are variable in different species.</li>
<li>Stamen has two parts.
<ol>
<li><strong>anther</strong> → It is the bilobed structure at the terminal of the stamen.</li>
<li><strong>filament</strong> → It is the long and slender stalk.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Gynoecium</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It is the female reproductive organ of the flower.</li>
<li>It consists of pistil.</li>
<li>If gynoecium consists of one pistil it is called <strong>monocarpellary</strong>. If it consists of more than one then it is called <strong>multicarpellary</strong>.</li>
<li>Each pistil consists of three structures.
<ol>
<li><strong>Stigma</strong> → It is where the pollen grains are landed.</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong> → It is the long slender part beneath the stigma.</li>
<li><strong>Ovary</strong> → It is the basal bulged part.
<ol>
<li>Inside the ovary there is <strong>ovarian cavity (locule).</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>placenta is located in the ovarian cavity</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Megasporongia</strong> arise from the placenta. Which are commonly known as <strong>Ovules</strong></li>
<li>Number of ovules in an ovary can be <strong>one(wheat, paddy, mango)</strong> or <strong>multiple (papaya, water melon, orchids)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="stamen-microsporongium-and-pollen-grain">Stamen, Microsporongium and pollen Grain</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>A typical angiosperm stamen is <strong>bilobed and dithecous</strong>.</li>
<li>A longitudinal groove runs lengthwise seperating the theca.</li>
<li>The anther is a <strong>tetragonial structure consisting four microsporongia in each four corners</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="microsporongium"><strong>Microsporongium</strong></h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>It devlops further to make pollen sacs.</li>
<li>They are packed with pollen grains.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In transverse section a typical microsporongia appears to be <strong>near circular in outline</strong>.</li>
<li>It has a four layer of walls srrounding it. From outside to inside it those are
<ol>
<li><strong>Epidermis</strong></li>
<li><strong>Endothecium</strong></li>
<li><strong>middle layer</strong></li>
<li><strong>tapetum</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Outermost three layers (epidermis, endothecium, middle layer) helps in protection and dehiscence of anther to release the pollen.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tapetum nourishes the pollen grains</strong>.</li>
<li>Tapetum has <strong>dense cytoplasm and usually have more than one neucleus</strong>.</li>
<li>When anther is young compactly arranged homogenous tissues occupies the middle of the microsporongium, these cells are called <strong>sporogenous tissue</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="microsporogenesis"><strong>Microsporogenesis</strong></h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Each microsporongium has lots of microspore mother cells/pollen mother cell (MMC/PMC)</li>
<li>Each cells of the sporongenous tissue undergo miotic division to form four cells which together are called Microspore Trtrad.</li>
<li>As the anther dehydrates and matures they disassociate from each other and each make pollen grain or microspore.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pollen-grain"><strong>Pollen Grain</strong></h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Each pollen grains are male gametophyte.</li>
<li>It is the yellowish powdery thing that sticks on your finger when you touch the anther of hibbiscus.</li>
<li>Pollen grains are <strong>generally spherical, and has a diameter of about 25-50 micrometers</strong>.</li>
<li>It has has prominent two layered wall.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exine</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is the outermost layer of the pollen grain.</li>
<li>It is made up of <strong>sporopollenin which is a fatty substance.</strong> <em><strong>It is one of the most resistant organic material known. It can withstand high temparature and acid and alkali. No engyme can degrade sporopollenin so far known.</strong></em>
3. It has prominent <strong>apertures which which are called germ pores</strong>, where sporopollenin is absent.
4. germ pores are required for fertilisation.
5. Pollen grains are <strong>well preserved as fossils because of this sporopollenin.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Intine</strong>
1. It is under the extine.
2. It is a thin continious layer <strong>made up of cellulose and pectin</strong>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>When pollen grains mature it contains two cells.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Vegitative Cell</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is bigger in size.</li>
<li>It has <strong>abundunt food reserve</strong>.</li>
<li>Necleus is irregularly shaped.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Generative Cell</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is smaller in size</li>
<li><strong>Spindle shaped</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dense cytoplasm and a necleus</strong>.</li>
<li>Pollen grains <strong>can cause allergic reactions, leading to chronic repiratory disorder like, asthma, bronchitis etc</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Parthenium or carrot grass that came into india as a contaminent with imported wheat, is cause of pollen allergy.</strong></li>
