			<p>WM stands for window manager. It is a alternative to using full blown desktop environment. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/window_manager">More info on ArchWiki</a></p>
<p>I have recently started using WM, first i3 now on openbox. And absolutely love it.</p>
<p>If you are someone who is used to use normal desktop environment like gnome, kde, xfce or any other <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment">DE (Desktop Environment)</a>, I&rsquo;d suggest to try out WM.You can start with anyone of those window manager you&rsquo;re comfortable with. Setting up wm is easy on fresh arch install so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a barrier.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-do-everything-using-keyboard-shortcuts">You can do everything using keyboard shortcuts.</h3>
<p>Opening windows, closing windows, moving to different workspaces etc, can be done using keyboard shortcuts. It took me few days to get used to use keyboard shortcuts but now i can say it&rsquo;s miles better than using mouse.</p>
<h3 id="one-window-doesnt-cover-another">One window doesn&rsquo;t cover another</h3>
<p>Yes it doesn&rsquo;t (by default), and why the hell would you want to keep one window on top of another?</p>
<h3 id="easily-customizable">Easily customizable</h3>
<p>I open up documentation in one workspace and vim with config file opened in another workspace. Changing everything is as easy as editing a text file. Documentations are mostly gets the job done, but if still doesn&rsquo;t work one quick brave Search or youtube search does it.</p>
<h3 id="loading-others-configuration">Loading other&rsquo;s configuration</h3>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t wanna configure everything by myself, so I&rsquo;d go <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> and load other&rsquo;s configuration. And  <em>voil√†</em> its done. Well in reality I still have to open the config file and tweak here and there, but it&rsquo;s usually &rsquo;less time consuming'.</p>
<h3 id="forces-you-to-use-the-terminal">Forces you to use the terminal</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty new when it comes to Linux. Although terminal doesn&rsquo;t scare me anymore, I sometimes still think using terminal is hard. Using a wm forces me to use terminal when possible.</p>
<h3 id="texts--icons">Texts &raquo;&gt; Icons</h3>
<p>I have never been a fan of icons, I&rsquo;d prefer simple texts over icons any day. A window manager normally doesn&rsquo;t have icons.</p>
<h3 id="its-minimal-less-distracting-more-productive">Its minimal, less distracting, more productive</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t spend any time trying to arrange my opened tabs. (Suck on that Windows users) I&rsquo;d open a programme because I want to open it, not because I was sitting mindlessly and getting bored.</p>
<h3 id="elitism-feeling">Elitism Feeling</h3>
<p>It comes with the OS, if you&rsquo;re a Linux user you know what I&rsquo;m taking about.</p>
<h1 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion:</h1>
<p>If you are still not convinced, I&rsquo;ll suggest you give it a try, take a break from conventional way of managing windows and embrace the new. You can always go back to doing things your way.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong>  I use Arch BTW</p>
