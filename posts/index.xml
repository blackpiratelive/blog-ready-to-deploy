      <description>Privacy is better on digital Journalism Easy to backup More customisable Less bulky Easier to write Automation Search and Reference  Better Privacy A daily journal is probably going to be one of the most private thing in your life. Because I know for a fact that, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how close you are to me I&amp;rsquo;m never going to share my journal with anyone but me. If you are able to write digitally right way then it is very much possible to have greater privacy than that you&amp;rsquo;d get in physical journal.</description>

      <description>WM stands for window manager. It is a alternative to using full blown desktop environment. More info on ArchWiki
I have recently started using WM, first i3 now on openbox. And absolutely love it.
If you are someone who is used to use normal desktop environment like gnome, kde, xfce or any other DE (Desktop Environment), I&amp;rsquo;d suggest to try out WM.You can start with anyone of those window manager you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with.</description>
