      <description>After listening lots of good things about fedora, I wanted to give it a try. I was previously using Archcraft, but recently it started to give me few errors. Dolphin won&amp;rsquo;t start for some reason. Same problem with OBS Studio also. I can live without dolphin, but needed obs studio. I got an workaround and used ffmpeg to record screen, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as good as obs studio. So I decided to distro-hop like any rational person would (I hope).</description>

      <description>WM stands for window manager. It is a alternative to using full blown desktop environment. More info on ArchWiki
I have recently started using WM, first i3 now on openbox. And absolutely love it.
If you are someone who is used to use normal desktop environment like gnome, kde, xfce or any other DE (Desktop Environment), I&amp;rsquo;d suggest to try out WM.You can start with anyone of those window manager you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with.</description>
