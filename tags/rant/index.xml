    <description><![CDATA[After listening lots of good things about fedora, I wanted to give it a try. I was previously using Archcraft, but recently it started to give me few errors. Dolphin won&rsquo;t start for some reason. Same problem with OBS Studio also. I can live without dolphin, but needed obs studio. I got an workaround and used ffmpeg to record screen, but it wasn&rsquo;t as good as obs studio. So I decided to distro-hop like any rational person would (I hope).]]></description>
