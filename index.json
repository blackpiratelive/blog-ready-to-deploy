Ability to use RegEx while creating emails with catch all: This means you can make a complex pattern that only you would know, and new emails would be created when that pattern matches only. It is useful if you are worried about spam when enabling catch all. Ability to use PGP: You can enable pgp to your mailbox. all incoming and outgoing emails would be encrypted using pgp.

My main source of apps is F-Droid along with Aurora Store (For those apps which are not avilable on Fdroid). I have added few extra F-Droid repositories. Below is a list of all the apps that are currently installed on my device. Brave Browser - My main browser Bromite - Secondary Browser Firefox NIghtly - I have it installed because I was using it previously, but do not use it now. Might uninstall later. Bitwarden - Opensource Password Manager with cross device syncing. Simple Mpbile Tools - It’s not a single app, but rather a collection of apps. I currently use their Calculator, Clock, Contacts, Draw, Gallery, Keyboard, SMS Messenger, Thank You, Voice Recorder apps. I would very much like to use their Phone app, but it doesn’t let you turn of speaker while calling. The problem with their Music Player app is that it doesnt let to scrobble. Graphene Os Camera - Because of no google play services support, normal gcam mod does not work. This camera app is very simple and gets the job done. They even have QR reader built into it, yay!!! DAVx5 - I use this app to sync my contacts using Fruux. Download Navi - It is my primary download manager. Although I use 1DM from time to time. Element - It is my Matrix client. I may change it later. FFUpdater - This app is used to update all my web browsers. Findroid - My Jellyfin client, Avilable on F-Droid through Izzydroid repo. Fluent Reader - My RSS reader app. Probably the “best” looking RSS reader app for Android. I use it with Inoreader. Infinity - This is a reddit client. It is opensource and has decent amount of features. Koler - Opensource Dialer app with minimal features. LetterBoxD - I use it to track movies that I have watched and find new movies. Libretorrent - I don’t do torrenting much on my phone, but have it on my phone, just in case. Adobe Lightroom - Wish there was a good opensource alternative for this. I like lightroom because you can download presets and apply it without having to do the hard work by yourself. Mastodon - Mastodon official client. Mixplorar - A file manager. It is probably the best file manager for android. Has built in tabs support, ability to add almost any cloud storage etc, (I should probably make a post about this app). It is not opensource. mpv - It is my alternative video player. sometimes use it. Nekogram - Opensource telegram app. I was previously using Plus messanger, but now starting to switch to nekogram. Plus Messanger - Telegram features with extra features, closed source. NewPipe and NewPipe x Sponsorblock - I was planning to move away from using official youtube app. Newpipe is a frontend for youtube. It has all the features that I need, but super buggy, non useable for primary youtube app. Noice - Opensource white noise app. Whenever I have trouble getting into sleep I put on my earphones, and try to sleep while listening. Pano Scrobbler - Last.fm and libre.fm scrobbler. Opensource. Plex - Jellyfin is good, but I have a hard time configuring it. So I have plex as alternative. Just wish that plex worked without internet connection. Pocket - My read later app. Proton Apps - I use ProtonMail, ProtonVPN, and Proton Calender. Raindrop - Bookmark manager. Opensource. Readwise - A service that lets you organize all your highlights from different places. Readwise WIdget - A simple app that lets you add an widget to your home screen which shows your readwise highlights. Magisk - Rooting app for android. Opensource. Showly - It is a tv show tracker which syncs with trakt.tv. SimpleLogin - It is an email aliasing service that lets you create aliases for each and every website. I also use this service to host email on my domain. Simplenote - A note taking app focuused on simplicity. I use it to write something down quickly. Snapdrop - Airdrop like app for android.

Other than these few problems there is nothing that effects me. Now let’s talk about all the other problems that you are likely to face if you are using android with Google Play Services. Notifications might not work if its dependent on Google Play Services. No Google Play Store, that means all your purchases won’t work. (You can get them working by using microg). Gcam does not work out of the box. There is an app that can fix this issue hopefully but I haven’t tested it yet. Banking apps won’t work. You can get them work with microg and magisk. Safety net won’t pass. You can make them pass with magisk and microg. If you are used to use ‘Login with Google’ you would either have to set a password for that app or create new account with email and password. A lot of apps would even refuse to open if you don’t have google play services installed. Despite its disadvantages you might want to try degoogling your phone, at least once and see if its going to work for you or not. If you are using propietory software most of the times, maybe you might wanna switch to FOSS alternatives. Most FOSS apps are not relient on Google Play Services. Most fundamental things like calling or texting works without any hiccups. It is very much possible to live with a degoogle phone and avoid big tech as much as possible.

Urethra originates from urinary bladder and ends in the external opening of penis called Urethral meatus Penis is external genitilia of male, it is made up of special tissue which helps in erection for insemination. The enlarged end of the penis is called glans penis and it is covered by foreskin. Male accessory glands include paired seminal vesicle, one prostate gland and a pair of bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these makes Seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium. The Female Reproductive System The feamle reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of oviducts (fallopian tubes), utereus, cervix, vagina, and external genetilia Ovaries are located two sides of the utereus of lower abdomen. Ovaries forms ovum Fallopian tubes extends from the periphery of the ovary to the utereus. fallopian tubes are 10-12 cm long. The funnel shaped thing near ovaries are called Infundibulum which has finger-like projections called fimbrie The part after infundibulum is called ampulla, it is wider, (this is the place where fertilisation takes place.) The part after ampulla is called isthmus, which connects to the utereus by a narrow lumen. The uterus is called womb. It is shaped as inverted pear. It has ligaments attacted to the pelvic region The uterus opens into vagina by a narrow cervix. i The cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal. The uterus has three layers. Permetruim - External thin membrenous tissue layer. Myometrium - middle thick layer of smooth muscles, exibits strong contractions during childbirth. Endometrium - inner glandular layer, it undergoes cyclical changes during menstrual cycle. Female external genitilia consists of mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, hymen. mons pubis is a coushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair. labia majora is a fleshy folds of tissue that extends from down the mons pubis and surround the vaginal opening. labia minora is under the labia majora. clitoris is a finger like structure which is located between the joints of two labia minora. sometimes vagina opening is partially covered by a membrane called hymen Hymen gets broken during the first intercourse (coitus), but it can also be broken by sudden fall or jolt, or by some sports like horseback riding, cycling etc, or by insertion of vaginal tampon etc. This is why it is not a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience. females have two mammary glands, which are called breasts. these glands contains glandular tissue and variable amount of fat. the grandular tissue of each breasts is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes. mammary lobes contains clusters of cells called alveoli. Alveoli secretes milk, which is stored inside the cavity (lumen) of alveoli. Alveoli opens into mammary tubules. The tubules from each lobe gets together and forms mammary duct. multiple mammary ducts joins the wider mammary ampulla which is connected to the lactiferous duct through which milk is sucked out.

It is opensource and by deafult does not sync to any cloud, (I think they have a paid plan now that lets you to sunc to their cloud). Even though their desktop app was decent android app sucked. The UI looks so outdated, it doesn’t have all the features that the desktop version has. Android app is also not very smooth. It has the ability to sync to dropbox but the sync is so slow. And if you have enabled end to end encryption through the settings, good luck getting it working properly. Keep in mind that most problems I had with this app is in their android app, beacuse thats what I used to use to write my journals.

I absolutely love this app. It uses normal markdown files for each and every note, you can create normal folders inside obsidian and it would show the folders. Because each and individual notes are just simple .md files you can open them using any kind of text editor you prefer. Right now I am using Vim to edit this text. Obsidian is not open source but it can work offline, only time it needs to connect to the internet is when downloading themes or plugins. Yes it supports themes, and I am pretty sure you can add your own css to obsidian. It also has template feature inbuilt, you can make it even more powerful with plugins. You can link your notes to another notes(Just like Roam Research, but you can only link a particular note and not a paragraph), and you can view a graph view which shows which note is linked with which. It is useful for me in so many cases, and not a lot of apps does that. Everything is offline in obsidain by default, which may sound like a drawback if you want to sync your data with multiple devices, but it is not. Sure it is not as straightforward as installing an app and logging in, but you can make it work. I personally use DropBox (I would move to nextcloud once I get my nextcloud server running on raspberry pi) to sync my files. In linux and windows you can use the official dropbox app to sync the obsidian folder, and on Android you can use AutoSync to sync to dropbox. Obsidian can be very powerful if you want it to be, but it can be simple too. Third party plugins can extend the functionality of the app. Plugins are also supported by their android app!!! How cool is that? Obsidian is very good at what it does. But by no means it is perfect. It is bit tricky to set up sync on your devices,(like I have mentioned above) and even if you are able to set it up properly, you might get conflicts. It doesn’t bother me because I am used to it at this point but I can see how this would make others annoyed.
